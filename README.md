This app is built for testing and educational purposes and is not intended to be published. Built using React.js, Firebase authentication, Semantic UI & Redux for the front-end. Node JS, [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) for the back-end. We used [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for the payments, [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) for showing the fundraiser locations on a map, [ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/) to display charts on the dashboard
